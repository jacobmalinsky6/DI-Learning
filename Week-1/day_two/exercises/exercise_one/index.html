    <h2><strong>About domestic cats</strong></h2>
    <p>
      They are often called <em>house cats</em> when kept as indoor pets or
      simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids
      and felines. They are often valued by humans for companionship.

    <h2><strong>History</strong></h2>
    <p>
      Cats were venerated in ancient Egypt, but there may have been instances of
      domestication as early as the Neolithic from around 9,500 years ago (7500
      BC). Did you know that, The felids are a rapidly evolving family of

    <h2><strong>The Lions</strong></h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Present in Africa and India, the lion typically inhabits grasslands and
      savannahs, but is absent in dense forests. It is usually more diurnal than
      other big cats, but when persecuted adapts to being active at night and at
      twilight. A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and
      cubs. Prides vary in size and composition from three to 20 adult lions,
      depending on habitat and prey availability. Females cooperate when hunting
      and prey mostly on large ungulates, including antelope, deer, buffalo,
      zebra and even giraffe
